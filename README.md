A collection of utility scripts that I find useful. I welcome any comments, 
suggestions, criticism (no matter how small you think they are). If you improve
any of the scripts please send me a pull request.

Some highlights:


* [stuff.pl](https://gitlab.com/d3k2mk7/rutils/blob/master/perl/stuff.pl) - show file after removing empty lines and comments

* perl/latest_unique/latest_unique.pl - print unique lines in a file by 
  preserving the order and retaining the latest of duplicated lines.
  
* perl/overlap/overlap.pl - Analyze the overlap between two sets of data

* perl/vim_swap.pl - makes it easy to recover from vim swap files
* zsh/lswap - show vim swap files

* perl/script_name.pl - get the script name
* perl/dictvim.pl - query dictionary and show results in gvim
