# Summary:
# Script to convert files to text
#
# Description:
# This script converts all the PDF and DOC files in a directory to
# corresponding text files. The text file will have the same name as the
# original document but will end with the .txt extension. For example, foo.doc
# will generate foo.txt.

        # for each type.

                # One advantage of using textract over pdftotext is that the
                # former can process multiple formats. For example, it can
                # handle both pdf and epub files.

                # actively maintained anymore? Commenting this out for now.
