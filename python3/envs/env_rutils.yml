    # BeautifulSoup4, html5lib, lxml are needed for read_html(). But they are
    # listed as optional dependencies.  To be specific, BeautifulSoup4 can work
    # with either of html5lib or lxml or both.
    # Per https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#io-html-gotchas
    # html5lib is slower but more accurate; lxml is faster but less accurate.
    # Prefer html5lib whenever possible but install both parsers.
